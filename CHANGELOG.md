# Changelog for Web Healer

## April 2025

- The player no longer auto-targets anything
- Balance reset, all values (health  and damage and heal etc) are much lower
- Advanced combat logging through <combat-log-viewer > 
- A <balance-monitor> component that I use to figure out why it's going as it is
- Redesign with <floating-panel>s. This was more to make it easier to debug the game rather than make it fun to play

Internals: added TinyBase for local persistance, an input-manager.js for handling, well, keyboard inputs, and set up CI deploys via Cloudflare.
