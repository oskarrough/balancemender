# Web Healer

A tactical game inspired by healing raids and five-man dungeons back in Azeroth. Who remembers Heal Rank 2? Keep your party alive, kill the enemies.

The game is an evening hobby project in progress and happy to welcome new contributors.

## Development

## Documentation

This is a website and uses vite as build system.

â†’

1. [`index.html`](./index.html) loads [`src/main.ts`](./src/main.ts)
2. main.ts renders the menu and sets up the dev tools
3. main.ts also creates a [`GameLoop`](./src/nodes/game-loop.ts). The game loop ties everything together. It continuously renders [`components/ui.ts`](./src/components/ui.ts) to its `element` DOM node (assigned via main). Actually, should just make it a web component.

The game uses the `vroum` (https://gitlab.com/jfalxa/vroum library). Vroum helps organize everything into `Nodes` and `Tasks` that run on a (Game)`Loop`.

To render DOM nodes, https://github.com/WebReflection/uhtml is used.

Animations are made using CSS and `gsap`.

See the [`DOCS.md`](./docs/) folder for more.

## Notes

- Most spells trigger a global cooldown (GCD) of 1.5 seconds. During this time you cannot cast any other spells
- Mana regen is paused for X seconds after a cast completes
