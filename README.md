# Web Healer

A little game for the web inspired by healing raids and five man dungeons back in Azeroth. Who remembers Heal Rank 2?

- Play on https://webhealer.0sk.ar

A work in progress and happy to welcome new contributors.

## Notes

- Most spells trigger a global cooldown (GCD) of 1.5 seconds. During this time you cannot cast any other spells
- Mana regen is paused for X seconds after a cast completes
- Show combat stats once combat ends: Amount healed, Overhealing, Mana spent

## Development

- `bun run dev` 

See `DOCS.md` for more.
